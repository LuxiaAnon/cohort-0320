Initializing a web application and configuring will always be the same.
Depending on the needs of your application the setup will probably defer.
But the core setup will remain the same.


1/ Initializing

    - mkdir YOUR_APPLICATION_FOLDER
    - cd ./YOUR_APPLICATION_FOLDER
    - npm init -y
    - git init (why not)
    - touch .gitignore
    - touch app.js or server.js or index.js (you can name this as you please but it's common to have either of these names)

2/ Adding a script to your package.json

script: {
    dev:"nodemon ./app.js -e hbs,js"
}


3/ Adding files / folders to ignore in the .gitignore file

    - .env
    - node_modules
